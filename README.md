Lensly is a sleek and responsive landing page for a glasses and sunglasses brand, built using HTML and CSS. It features a clean layout with product showcases, promotional sections, and user-friendly design.

Key highlights:

Product display with images and descriptions

Well-structured layout using flexbox/grid

Header, footer, and promotional content

A contact form that shows a personalized thank you message when submitted â€” visible only to the user and disappears after 3 seconds

This project helped practice layout techniques and interactivity while emphasizing clean, aesthetic design and user experience.
